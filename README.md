* Emphasize what makes you different from other qualified applicants in your field
* Tailor skills and experience to the position you are applying for
* Be specific but avoid being wordy
* Experience matters more so than education
* Always try to phrase your bullet points as impact statements
* Be honest! Don't exaggerate! You will be challenged!
* I don't care who you are; don't exceed one page
* Suggested Sections: Header, Summary, Related Experience, Education, Additional
* Again, less is more
* You don't need pictures, charts, tables, crazy colors, etc.

## Previous Experience

## Personal Projects
* You can make this a separate section or include it under your other experiences

## Additional Experience

## Awards
* Unless you are in your first or second year of college, don't include anything from high school! (e.g. SAT scores, being an eagle scout, etc.)

## Hobbies

* This should not be prioritized but if you add a little section at the bottom of your resume, it can help break the ice on an interview
